	To properly test the program, you would first need to install NetBeans on your computer. 
	After installing it, you open the project(File->Open Project) . In order to Run it, all you have to do is press the green arrow (top left).	
	The program starts with the LogIn page. You will notice that you can not enter the application(error message appears) without a set of credentials. 
Username: Alex
Password: 30077
	After logging in, you will proceed to the next page, where you can choose between the three options. The MAIN functionality goes to Borrow Books. Here you have a search button that lists all the books. If you want to select one of them, you need to insert its ID in the field and press Check. (Note: The first ID has no copies available.)
Several fields will appear that will allow you to borrow the book(after inserting the return date). If you want to continue the process and borrow another book, you should press the button “Next Book”.


The program retrieves data from the files. You can find them in the ModernLibrary directory.
